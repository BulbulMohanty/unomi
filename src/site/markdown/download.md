# Verify the integrity of the files

It is essential that you verify the integrity of the downloaded files using the PGP or MD5 signatures.

The PGP signatures can be verified using PGP or GPG. First download the [KEYS](http://www.apache.org/dist/incubator/unomi/KEYS) as well as the PGP signature file for the 
relevant file. Make sure you get these files from the main distribution directory, rather than from a mirror. Then 
verify the signatures using, for instance:

    % gpg --import KEYS
    % gpg --verify unomi-1.2.0-incubating.tar.gz.asc unomi-1.2.0-incubating.tar.gz
