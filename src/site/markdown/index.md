# The Open Source Customer Data Platform

## Apache Unomi in one sentence
Apache Unomi is __a Java Open Source customer data platform__, a Java server designed to manage customers, 
leads and visitors’ data and help personalize customers’ experiences. 

## For developers 
* Uses ElasticSearch for data storage, dynamic data structure
* Highly scalable architecture
* Very simple to deploy and install (simply unzip & run)
* Uses Apache Karaf as the OSGi runtime 
* Full & simple REST API
* Extensible through plugin architecture (using OSGi & simple JSON descriptors)
* Apache Open Source project

## For IT stakeholders and business users
* First-Party Data Collection and Ownership
* Persistent and consolidated profiles for all your audience (customers & leads), storing anonymous and personally 
identifiable information
* Regulation-proof and privacy management built-in 
* Real-Time Decisioning (Scoring logics, segmentation)
* Open standard, easy integration and extension

## Why would you need a Customer Data Platform ? 
Organizations collect data from multiple sources and channels - sales, web, emails, mobile, brick and mortar - and 
all of this data is spread across different departments and technologies. As a result, many professionals are lacking 
the data they need to do their job, especially data analysts and marketers.

A customer data platform helps business users collect all the customer data in one place, providing a complete view 
of the customers. When the data is collected, the customer data platform will also play a key role in choosing which 
content or offer is more relevant to a customer. 

## The Apache Unomi advantage 
Each organization is unique and will always have specific needs, this is why Apache Unomi has been designed to 
be extended and to ease the integration of external data. The embedded features such as segmentation, scoring and 
built-in privacy will be appreciated by business users while horizontal scalability and open source positioning will 
be loved by developers and architects. 

Apache Unomi is also the reference implementation of the upcoming OASIS Context Server (CXS) standard 
(https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/cxs/) to help standardize personalization of customer experience while promoting 
ethical web experience management and increased user privacy controls. 

## Business cases based on Unomi
* Build a web personalization software to adapt the content on your website to your audience
* Collect data from mobile application and feed Apache Unomi to track and understand your customers’ journeys 
* Connect the beacons deployed in your stores to Apache Unomi and consolidate the profile of your customers and leads across all these channels
* Automatically push profiles from Apache Unomi to your CRM when a lead reach a given number of points in one of your scoring plans

### Disclaimer

Apache Unomi is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC. Incubation is required 
of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized 
in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability 
of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
